<h1>Brendan Hill</h1>
<p>	Welcome!!!!!!!
My name is Brendan Hill I going to high school at Gems World Academy. My goal is to win a science contest such as the google science fair. If i could win it would be a dream come true. I have competed in things like this like the global design challenge. I didn't win at that so I hope I can learn from my mistakes and make inprovements.
I love marvel because it has cool inventions and geneticly modified humans. I like to think about what I would be or do if I lived in the Marvel MCU. I think if I weren't a hero or mutant or inhuman I would be a "scrapper" like the vulture and grab pieces from battles. 
One of my engineering goals is to make a iron man gauntlet. Mabye change the color and style a little so it won't look exactly like the real thing. I was inspired by tony stark to go againtst everyone and find a motive to work hard on something cool like how he made the suit. </p>
<div><h2>Hobbies</h2> <p>I like sports and video games. My favorite video games are fortnite and blackops 4. I also like to go to my lake house during the weekends and summer.</p>
